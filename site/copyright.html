                References made to Coursera, Johns Hopkins University, GitHub, or course instructor Yaakov Chaikin are not meant to
                convey any insult, disparagement, disapproval, or any other negative connotation. Links provided in this page that
                lead to to other reference and tutorial services are only intended to provide further information about the
                material, and only to be used as accompanying materials in order to enhance the outcome of student experiences
                within the course. This page is only intended to provide updated information about the material covered by the first
                week of the HTML/CSS/Javascript course by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera, as well as links to files of those
                types created by Mike Stress in order to solve problems presented within the course material. All original documents
                are the Intellectual Property of the person who wrote them. In the case of this GitHub repository, the author of all
                original documents (including this one) is Mike Stress under the GitHub username SMudJeS. No payment will ever be
                requested or expected for the material within this GitHub repository. Anyone purporting to be Mike Stress and
                requesting payment for the work presented within the repository <i>must</i> be assumed to be a scammer and will
                therefore be subject to Coursera's policies regarding such actions, as well as the policies of GitHub and Johns
                Hopkins University, AND the personal scorn of course instructor Yaakov Chaikin and all enrolled students of the
                course.
