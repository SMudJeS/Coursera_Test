              Hello fellow students from the Coursera/Johns Hopkins HTML/CSS/Javascript course!
            </i>
          </b>
          <br>
          Here I will be posting some HTML/CSS/Javascript files that are solutions to the problems presented to us within the course, posted for peer review; and at some point I would also like to create some type of updated information for the course, including getting through the Git setup headache a bit more smoothly.

            Note to instructor Yaakov that, while in my opinion GitHub is very good and useful for uploading and hosting these pages for students, it is important to remain in-vogue with the more popular options available on the Web for public uploads from students. A cloud storage box (Google Drive or Dropbox) is an example of something just a <sub>tiny</sub> bit more user-friendly for beginners, and while they aren't <i>always</i> free for huge amounts of data and files, some of them have free options that can give your free account space of up to 100 GiB.

                Also, in my honest opinion, VS Code is a bit more popular and user-friendly than the simple text-editors, and its intuitive plugin set make it very easy to format the code we are learning without having to pay too much attention to document formatting techniques such as tab trees. It's also free and users can easily add plugins that will help them code in multiple languages such as Python, C, C++, and Java, without having to download multiple editors and compilers.

              I know that a lot of the material at the beginning of this course is a total major pain to get through, but I assure you all that it is both necessary and worthwhile to get through in order to receive the credits via Coursera and have your work be visible and reviewable by myself and the rest of our peers. So until someone can convince the Powers That Be that there are easier options available to us in the present than there were in the time that the material was created, it is crucial that we are all able to properly get our materials created and published for peer review. That is the reason I want to try to create some type of update to the content in the course, particularly in the Environment Setup section, to help make things simpler and help us all get into learning coding faster. After all, that's what we're all here for.
