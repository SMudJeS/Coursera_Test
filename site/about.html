                            Hello fellow students from the Coursera/Johns Hopkins HTML/CSS/Javascript course!
                        </i>

                    <br>
                    Here I will be posting some HTML/CSS/Javascript files that are solutions to the problems presented to us within
                    the course, posted for peer review; and at some point I would also like to create some type of updated
                    information for the course, including getting through the Git setup headache a bit more smoothly.

                    Note to instructor that, while in my opinion GitHub is very good and useful for uploading and hosting these
                    pages for students, it is also my opinion that it is important to remain in-vogue with the more popular options
                    available on the Web for public uploads from students. A cloud storage box (Google Drive or Dropbox) is an
                    example of something just a <sub><sup><i>tiny</i></sup></sub> bit more user-friendly for beginners, and while
                    they aren't <i>always</i> free for huge amounts of data and files, some of them have free options that can give
                    your free account space of up to 100 GiB.

                    Also, in my honest opinion, VS Code is a bit more popular and user-friendly than the simple text-editors, and
                    its intuitive plugin set make it very easy to format the code we are learning without having to pay too much
                    attention to document structuring techniques such as tab trees. It's also free and users can easily add plugins
                    that will help them code in multiple languages such as Python, C, C++, and Java, without having to download
                    multiple editors and compilers.

                        Anyway, you can navigate the local site within this repository with the navbar up top, and all of them will display in the iframe in the index page, except for the Copyright link, which loads to the bottom of the index page. All external links in the links page open in new tabs or browser windows, depending on your specific individual settings.
