                                Hello fellow students from the Coursera/Johns Hopkins HTML/CSS/Javascript course!
                            </i>
                        </b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Here I will be posting some HTML/CSS/Javascript files that are solutions to the problems presented to us within the course, posted for peer review; and at some point I would also like to create some type of updated information for the course, including getting through the Git setup <b><i>headache</i></b> a bit more smoothly.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So feel free to bookmark this site, because I will be be updating it even after I complete the course!
                        <br>
                        ALSO! Feel free to contact me through the e-mail link to let me know if you'd like me to set up some type of message board where we can interact with each other!

                    Seriously, I've tried it on my phone and it's awful in portrait mode. I'll figure it out.
