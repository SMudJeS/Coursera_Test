                                Hello fellow students from the Coursera/Johns Hopkins HTML/CSS/Javascript course!
                            </i>
                        </b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Here I will be posting some HTML/CSS/Javascript files that are solutions to the problems presented to us within the course, posted for peer review; and at some point I would also like to create some type of updated information for the course, including getting through the Git setup headache a bit more smoothly.
                        <br>
                        So feel free to bookmark this site, because I will be be updating it even after I complete the course!
                    </p>
                    <br>
