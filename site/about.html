                                Hello fellow students from the Coursera/Johns Hopkins HTML/CSS/Javascript course!
                            </i>
                        </b>

                        <br>
                        Here I will be posting some HTML/CSS/Javascript files that are solutions to the problems presented to us within the course, posted for peer review; and at some point I would also like to create some type of updated information for the course, including getting through the Git setup <b><i>headache</i></b> a bit more smoothly. So feel free to bookmark this site, because I will be be updating it even after I complete the course!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        ALSO! Feel free to contact me through the e-mail form to let me know if you'd like me to set up some type of message board where we can interact with each other!
