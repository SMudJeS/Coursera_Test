                I was born in the "Downriver" section of Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in a neighborhood directly between West Palm Beach and Royal Palm Beach, in Florida. I started playing keyboard (the musical kind) at around 7-8 years old when a neighbor gave me a Radio Shack (showing my age) keyboard with teacher software built-in that would stop every note of the song until you played the right note. Later, at around 13 I started playing the drums, and at around 16 I started playing guitar. I thought music was going to be the <s>best</s><b><i> only</i></b> way for me to be taken seriously.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Behind the scenes of this musically-inclined youth was a total nerd <i>itching</i> to be noticed and acknowledged.</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                I grew up in a time and setting where the geeky kids who liked Japanese cartoons and playing video games and building computer programs and websites (the nerds) were very much not respected among peers. I was bullied a lot. I took some Computer Programming courses in high school (Pascal and C++) but had to <i>duck</i> out of the classroom every day. This side of me (the side I'm revealing in this site) was not allowed to thrive. I created Internet aliases for myself and used them to build small websites using free services like Angelfire and Geocities, just to indulge myself in the little bit of coding that I understood. I used to view the page sources for my favorite websites and edit all of the elements to teach myself what tags performed what functions. I learned a little bit of inline CSS and I learned <code>iframe</code> (probably my favorite HTML element) and a few other things that I still use.
                <br>
                <br>
                Eventually I gave in to peer pressure and hung up my coding gloves. I enrolled in school to work in Audio Production and I soon forgot all the coding I knew, since now my head was being filled with information about Digital Signal Processing and Music Theory. My inner nerd went to sleep for a while.
                <br>
                <br>
                It ended up being a <b>long</b> nap.
                <br>
                In the interim, I got married, became a father of 2 amazing boys, Robbie and Joey, and eventually even my beloved music fell by the wayside. Then we got divorced and I'm now trying to make a change in my life by bringing the things I'm passionate about back into my life. I bought a refurbished Windows PC and some audio equipment and started setting all of that up. My current girlfriend saw how talented I showed myself to be with setting up my multi-display workstation and she saw an ad for Coursera's Google IT Support Specialist Certificate program and encouraged me to enroll. Being enrolled in that course inspired me to get back into coding, and enroll in Coursera's HTML/CSS/Javascript For Web Developers course and get back into building websites and reawaken the skills that I thought I had completely forgotten about, as well as pick up on some new ones.

                I also enrolled in a C/C++ course but the instructor did this constant lip-smacking that was sometimes the only thing I could hear in his videos; and he would write programs by hand on a whiteboard, which is fine for teaching the proper formatting, but it wasn't very helpful when his handwriting was just a couple tiers above chicken-scratch. I wrote a program in C offering my services as an audio engineer but also announcing my unenrollment from the course, with the closing line reading <code>Goodbye World</code>, as a reference to the first program written in C, which printed <code>Hello World</code>. True nerd fashion.

                I am currently awaiting acceptance to Arizona State University's Online Bachelor program in Information Technology, and in the future after completing that, would like to start a business building custom PCs for content creators. Ideally I would like to fully design these PCs from the ground up, including creating the software that the users will be using, and the Operating System that it all runs on. I currently have source code downloaded for some open-source editing software that is helping me figure out how to design those applications, and open-source web browsers are kind of a dime a dozen these days, so web developers will be able to have their fun, too! I know very little about building an OS for now, but I am working on honing my skills more and more and working towards my goal!
